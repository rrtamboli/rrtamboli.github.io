== Early Stage Researcher  (01\/2018 - 12\/2018).
[https://www.holografika.com/ Holografika Kft.], under the [http://www.qoenet-itn.eu/ QoE-NET project]

This position was funded from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 643072, Network QoE-Net.

During this term, I worked on assessment of perceptual quality of experience (subjective and objective) pertaining to projection-based light-field displays.\n
In particular, I explored the orientation preferences of 3D objects via user-interaction, viewing conditions of light-field video content, key performance indicators of light field visualization, light field compression, etc.\n
This research resulted in 13 co-authored publications, of which 2 are journal articles.\n
I also attended a few workshops, conferences and training sessions which took place within the European Union.\n

== Intern 
Yokohama Research Laboratory, Hitachi Ltd. 

This internship was realized under the [http://friendship.iith.ac.in/ "Project for Future Researchers at Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad (IIT-H) to Enhance Network Development with Scholarship of Japan"].

This internship involved a pilot study on Compressive Sensing (CS) for Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging. Several existing sampling schemes and CS reconstruction algorithms were tested on real MR images.
